## Instalation

* Install [Yii 2](http://www.yiiframework.com/download)
* Install package via [composer](http://getcomposer.org/download/) `"cyneek/yii2-fileupload": "dev-master"`
* Update config file _'config/web.php'_

```
    'modules' => [
		'fileupload' => [
            'class' => 'cyneek\yii2\fileupload\Module'
		]
		// set custom modules here
    ],
```
* Make a _routes_ directory in your @app level.
* Insert files in this directory using the Route class definition.
* Profit!


## Definition

Note:

This routing system uses the Yii2 urlManager parameters by default:

* enablePretttyUrl = TRUE

* enableStrictParsing = TRUE

* showScriptName = FALSE


### Basic routing

The basic routing methods will make a new route comprehensible by the Yii2 system.

```
Route::get('user',            'user/index');
Route::post('user/(:any)',    'user/load/$1');
Route::put('user/(:any),      'user/update/$1');
Route::delete('user/(:any)',  'user/delete/$1');
Route::head('user',           'user/index');
Route::patch('user/(:any),    'user/update/$1');
```

The developer also can use two additional methods that will let him work with more than one http verbs at the same time.

`any` will let the route work under any HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, HEAD, PATCH),

```
Route::any('user',            'user/index');
```

`match` let's the developer to define manually a group of HTTP verbs that will the only ones that respond to this route.

```
Route::match(['GET', 'POST'], 'user', 'user/index');
```

### Named routes

Additionally there can be defined a group of additional properties in the basic routing methods.
 
 One of them it's the route naming, that will let the developer use their defined web url using only it's name instead of use all their chain.
 
```
Route::set_name('user_update', 'admin/user/load/');

Route::get('user', 'user/index', ['as' => 'user']);
```

To get a route url by it's name there is only necessary to

```
echo Route::named('user');

redirect(Route::named('user'));
```

In case the route has named parameters, it's possible to define values for them in a second parameter of the method `named`

```
Route::named('user', ['id' => 12]);
```

If the route has optional named parameters without a defined value, they won't be shown in the method's return url string.

### Named parameters

It's possible to define named parameters instead of the regular expressions used by Yii2 in the parameter routing system. This will let the developer to use them in getting it's values during the application lifetime.

There are two additional defined wildcards, `(:any)` that matches with the regular expression "any character" and `(:num)` that matches with the regex "any number".

```
Route::any('user/{id}',     'user/load');
```

There are two ways of defining named parameters. The global definition, that will assign that regular expression or wildcard to all parameters with that name in all the routes defined in the application, and the local definition, that will only affect the route in which it's defined and will REWRITE any global route with the same name in this route.

#### Global definition

```
Route::pattern('id',        '\d+');
Route::pattern('name',      '(:any)');
```

#### Local definition

```
Route::any('user/{id}',     'user/load')->where('id', '\d+');
```

It's also possible to use arrays in the local definition to assign more than one parameter at the same time.

```
Route::any('user/{id}/{name}',     'user/load')->where(['id' => '\d+', 'name' => '(:any)']);
```

### Optional named routes

There also can be defined optional parameters. This will let Yii2 use the route having or not an URI defined in that position. The definition of optional parameters it's the same as the normal named parameters but adding a question mark `?` in it's definition.
 
```
Route::any('user/{id?}',    'user/load')->where('id', '\d+');
```

This will make Yii2 to accept the routes "user" and "user/12" having being necessary only one line for that.

It's possible to stack different optional parameters in the same route, being also possible to access all the routes which the different permutations will make.

```
Route::any('user/{id?}/{name?}',   'user/load');
```

This will make possible to access to "user/12/john", "user/john", "user/12", "user".

### Getting named parameter values

The route class has also a syntactic sugar method that let access to the parameter values defined in the route.

```
Route::input('id');
```

### Route filters

There is also possible to define Yii2 type or manual filters in the Route class. This coexists at the same time with the normal filtering system of Yii2 that defines the filters in the `behaviors` method of each Controller. It's only an additional option that lets the developer to define filters by route level instead of Controllar and Action level. 

There are two types of filters that the developer can use in the routing system. The Yii2 normal filters and a special kind of route that uses closures defined in the user as filters.

#### Yii2 filters

To assign a filter of this type in a route there is only necessary to add an additional entry in the options parameter called `filter`. This will make that, when the route is called, the system will search for this filter and execute it.

```
Route::any('user/{id}', 'user/load', ['filter' => 'logged_in']);
```

To define the filter, it's necessary to make an array with the basic data of a normal Yii2 filter and give it a name.

```
Route::filter('logged_in', [
		  'class' => \yii\filters\AccessControl::className(),
		  'except' => [ 'user/default/login'],
			'rules' => [
				[
					'actions' => ['logout'],
					'allow' => true,
					'roles' => ['@'],
				],
			],
  ]);
```

#### Manual filters

Additionally  its possible to define special filters make manually by the developer in the form of anonymous functions or closures that let run Yii2 code inside of them.

To assign a filter of this kind in a route it's necessary to add a new additional entry in the options parameter that can be `before` in the case we want the filter to be launched before the Controller's Action is executed or `after` in case we want to launch it after that.

```
Route::any('user/{id}', 'user/load', ['before' => 'check_this']);
```

To define the filter, it's required to make a closure and assign it to the Route class.

```
Route::filter('check_this', function(){
				if (Route::input('id') > 12)
				{
						throw new \yii\web\NotFoundHttpException(\Yii::t('yii', 'Page not found.'));
				}
				else
				{
					return TRUE;
				}
		});
```

#### Multiple filters

```
Route::any('user/{id}', 'user/load', ['before' => ['logged_in', 'check_params']]);
Route::any('user/{id}', 'user/load', ['filter' => 'logged_in|check_params']);
```

#### Pattern based filters

You may also specify that a filter applies to an entire set of routes based on their URI.

```
Route::when('admin\/(.*)', ['filter' =>'logged_in']);
```

In the example above, the `admin` filter would be applied to all routes beginning with `admin/`.

You may also constrain pattern filters by HTTP verbs:

```
Route::when('admin\/(.*)', ['filter' =>'logged_in'], [get]);
```

### Route groups

This lets the developer adding a series of options in a group of routes masively. It's main utility it's to add url prefixes to a group of routes.

```
Route::group(['prefix' => 'admin', 'filter' => 'logged_in'], function(){
     Route::post('update/(:any)', 'user/update');
});
```

### Subdomain routing

Sometimes an application can give support to some subdomains. For that it's possible to define specific routes for that subdomains.

It's only necessary to define the parameter that will hold the subdomain and the Route class will make the heavy lifting.

```
Route::any('user/{id}', 'user/load', ['domain' => '{id}']);
```
